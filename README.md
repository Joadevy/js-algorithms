This repository is for containing different practices of algorithms in javascript so as to start working with the language and evolving on it.
Firstly I took the [maxiprograma's](https://maxiprograma.com/) introductory guide for algorithms and his exercises and I adappted it for start learning javascript. 
Then I took the [Lucas Dalto's](https://www.youtube.com/c/soydalto) javascript course (junior level) and did the exercises proposed for learning. It contains exercises for learning javascript by the base of the language. Through each chapter of the course I learned more about and walked deep into the language by resolving different challenges.
